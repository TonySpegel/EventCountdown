# EventCountdown 

EventCountdown is a simple Android app that displays the remaining time until the start of a calendar event in human-readable form as a home screen widget

The app/widget is mainly for myself and my very first attempt  using Jetpack Compose/Glance. 

## Features

- Widget/Calendar selection using homescreen
